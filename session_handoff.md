## What Was Done

### Infrastructure (Max, Sessions 1–3, 2026-06-15)
- Scaffolded Next.js + Cloudflare Workers + Supabase project
- Auth wiring: `lib/supabase/client.ts`, `lib/supabase/server.ts`, `middleware.ts`
- Applied migrations 0001 + 0002 (8 tables, RLS, triggers, audit log, cert queue)
- Fixed CF Workers 500 error (Supabase realtime WebSocket detection)
- 10/10 cross-tenant RLS isolation test passed
- Worker secrets set in CF dashboard

### Email / DNS setup (Rob, 2026-06-16)
- `info@aistaffcompliance.com` alias on Zoho, delivers to Rob's inbox
- Cloudflare DNS fully configured: Zoho MX/DKIM/SPF, Resend DKIM/verification/bounce MX, DMARC (p=none)
- Resend sending domain verified ✅

### Architecture confirmed (Rob, 2026-06-16)
- `aistaffcompliance.com` → Netlify (main marketing site — stays there permanently)
- Training app → Cloudflare Workers at `training.aistaffcompliance.com`
- Netlify site links into the CF training app — does NOT move to CF

### Landing page + Stripe backend (Max, Sessions 5–6, 2026-06-16)
- Full Stitch design: `hero-section.tsx` (Lora scrabble tiles, word cycling, shader bg, Framer Motion), `shader-bg.tsx` (WebGL), `features-section.tsx` (glass cards, bento, footer)
- `app/api/checkout/route.ts` — Stripe Checkout endpoint ✅
- `lib/supabase/admin.ts` — service role client
- `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` — full webhook handler

### Auth + full app flow (Max, Session 7, 2026-06-16)
- **Onboarding:** `/onboarding` polls for firm provisioning, collects firm name, generates magic link
- **Auth flows:** `/login`, `/forgot-password`, `/update-password`, `/auth/callback`, `/auth/confirm`, `/api/auth/logout`, middleware route protection
- **Employee invite:** `/api/invite`, `/dashboard` (admin + employee views), member table, seat tracking
- **Mark pass stub:** `/dashboard/training`, `/api/training/mark-pass` — exercises full pipeline: course → enrollment → quiz_attempt → cert_generation_queue

## Immediate Next Steps

### For Rob (can do now)
- `pnpm dev` → open `http://localhost:3000` to review landing page
- Add BSBR Holdings LLC address in Stripe Tax → unblocks live-mode Stripe objects
- Decide: should the attorney-admin count as a seat? (currently they don't)

### For next dev session
1. **Set `RESEND_API_KEY` secret** — key is in the **RMT Portal**; retrieve it and run `wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY` in `workers/cert-worker/`. Do this first — tasks 2 and 3 both depend on it.
2. **Resend email wiring** — three TODO spots in code:
   - `app/api/onboarding/complete/route.ts` — admin magic link
   - `app/api/invite/route.ts` — employee invite link
   - Cert delivery email (when cert Worker is built)
3. **Cert generation Worker** — CF Worker that processes `cert_generation_queue`, generates PDF via `pdf-lib`, uploads to Supabase Storage `certificates/firms/{firm_id}/employees/{user_id}/{enrollment_id}.pdf`, inserts into `certificates`
4. **Real CF Stream video** — upload video, update `courses.cloudflare_stream_video_id` in Supabase

## Design Decision — Firm Admin Model (locked 2026-06-16, Rob)

**Decision: Option B — firm account is management-only; purchaser decides if they're also a trainee.**

The current model (admin = free, separate from seats) does not fit the real use case. In practice the person signing up is most likely an office manager or staff member who also needs to complete the training — not a free admin-only account.

**New model:**
- The person who purchases creates the firm account and gets dashboard/management access
- They are NOT automatically a trainee — they choose during onboarding
- Onboarding adds a checkbox: *"I also need to complete this training"* — if checked, they are added to the trainee list and consume one seat
- Seats purchased = number of trainees (may or may not include the purchaser)
- `used_seats` count = enrolled trainees only; the firm account holder doesn't count unless they enrolled themselves

**What this means for Max:**
- The current `firm_admin` as a free non-seat account needs to be reworked
- Onboarding flow needs the opt-in checkbox before the invite list
- `used_seats` logic needs to reflect this
- ⚠️ **Do not build further on the current admin model until this is synced with Rob**

**Future idea (not now):** A separate shorter course aimed at attorneys themselves (understanding Rule 5.3 supervisory obligations) — different audience, different product, post-launch consideration.

## Open Questions

- Should Supabase prod project live under Rob's account or Max's?
- Stripe Tax: state registrations + CPA consult still open (Rob)
- `RESEND_API_KEY` — key is in RMT Portal; Max to retrieve and run `wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY` (assigned, next session)
- Landing page at `app/page.tsx` — keep as training subdomain entry point or simplify to redirect?
